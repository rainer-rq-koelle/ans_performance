Hello World! 

This book project is my challenge for 2017. Thus, what you are looking at is a draft that will materialise throughout the year (and beyond).
This online repository comprises the most recent state of this development to encourage comments and/or suggestions.
For any immediated feedback or recommendations, please send an email at rainer.koelle@eurocontrol.int.

The principal aim is to bring together topic presentations and lectures I gave on Operational Performance in Air Navigation. 
I started working for the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit in late 2013. 
While having an operational background with experience in aviation and air traffic control, I had to venture into various fields to get a better grip on my day-to-day subject.
This journey included and continues to include daily discussions about concepts, approaches, methodologies, and ultimately metrics for performance measurement.

One of - my personal - key lessons learnt from these discussions is that there exists no shortage on varying numerical approaches while the conceptual approach and the associated terminology is frequently fuzzy or ill-adopted.
Discussions typically revolve around the potential weakness of a metric, not included factors, or other perceived shortcomings.

Over time,  a steady collection of personal notes developed supporting me in my day-to-day job.
Realising that there is no reference book on Operational ANS Performance, this project is an attempt to pull these discussions and notes together.

I make no committment as regards the end of this project. I have a busy job and family life, and enjoy quite some other spare time activities.
The committment for 2017 however is to establish a solid foundation for a text on Operational ANS Performance.
