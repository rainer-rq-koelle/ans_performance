# Operational ANS Performance {-}

Operational performance analysis of air transportation and air navigation is essential to address the capabilities of local or regional systems, and the impact of capabilities or operational procedures.

This book project is an attempt of bringing together material to establish a foundation for operational ANS performance and to harmonise the application of operational performance indicators.

As part of the R/RStudio universe, this book has been produced with the bookdown package.
