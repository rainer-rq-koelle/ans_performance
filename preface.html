<h2>About this book</h2>
<p>This book is a reaction to my professional day-to-day experience. There is a steady debate about perceived shortcomings of performance metrics and why another metric is better suited for measuring a specific aspect of air transportation.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I made several observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance of air navigation, in general, is discussed on different levels ranging from policy / strategic level to low-level numerical aspects by individuals with diverse backgrounds in terms of profession and training;</li>
<li>these <em>performance experts</em> tend to mix concepts, methodologies, and the related terminology without a more profound separation of terms and so-called frameworks;</li>
<li>there is a heavy focus on the metric, i.e. a key performance metric, that should be ‘simple’ yet uniquely attributable to one actor and considering all potential factors that may influence the metric;</li>
<li>there is a competition of projects (and programmes) to identify and develop new/different metrics, and ultimately proliferating the universe of (operational) performance measures;</li>
<li>… (too many to list them all here)</li>
</ul>
<p>This book does not ascribe to the idea of the <strong>One Ring</strong> in the ‘Lord of the Rings’ to ‘rule them all’. However, the aim of this book is to provide a reference work for (Operational) Performance in Air Navigation.</p>
<p>Writing this book has been a journey in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, it helped and forced me to proper formulate topics, ideas, and concepts I had compiled over the years; and</li>
<li>second, it flags how much I still do not know and need to study in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, this book is not the <strong>ultimate answer</strong>, but provides a bais for the interested reader to understand the concepts of performance management and how it applies to air navigation (and possibly air transportation). And, in particular, this book aims to facilitate the aforementioned discussions.</p>
<p>The book is divided into several parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part is targeted at high-level performance concepts and as such applicable in general.</li>
<li>The second part focusses on operational aspects.</li>
</ul>

<div id="who-should-read-this-book" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Who should read this book?</h2>
<p>This book is written for everybody with an interest in (operational) performance of air navigation. The audience therefore includes interested readers, managers, regulators, and researchers.</p>
<p>Addressing such a spectrum poses a challenge. While I aim to provide respective links to supporting material, I understand that <strong>interested</strong> describes a reader with some basic aviation or air traffic management knowledge or the desire to acquire the required background knowledge outside this book.</p>
<p>For students (or young professionals) I plan to add a set of questions at the end of each chapter to facilitate the learning process.<br />
Note: This feature may develop asynchron from the book content.</p>

<div id="about-the-author" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>About the author</h2>
<p>My life revolves around aviation: I am an aviator, air traffic controller, and researcher.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I work for the Performance Review Unit of &lt;a href=‘<a href="http://www.eurocontrol.int" class="uri">http://www.eurocontrol.int</a>’, target=’_blank’&gt;EUROCONTROL</a>.</p>
<p>Part of my research picks up on my day-to-day activities with a focus on applying data science to assessing the operational performance of air navigation services and / or air transportation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am affiliated with the School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, United Kingdom, as an aviation and air traffic management expert. At Lancaster my research interests revolve around aviation / air navigation security, and in particular, security situation management.</p>
<p>When I am not working, flying, or researching, I enjoy American Football (I used to play Fullback), reading, and a good walk. Originating from the south of Germany, i.e. Baden-Württemberg, makes me like Weizen und Wurstsalat :).</p>
